Ok, so I'm starting to play around with the idea of automatically generating mazes. To do this, I figured I should
probably start to set up a unit testing framework, because of the difficulties in generating paths and such things.
However, when I tried that, I got a junit/textui/ResultPrinter error, because the JUnit shipped with Android was
incompatible with IntelliJ. In order to fix this, I simply used the junit jars in IntelliJ's own directory, and moved
them above the android library in the project dependencies list. That seemed to fix it ... so far.

Need to combined Joiner and Hyena to make walls for maze
Random seed for regenerating same maze. Integrate with shuffle somehow.

 - random seed specification
 - checkpoint graphic
 - include / exclude start position from been list
 - infinitely looping ?

 - arrows left and right and go for eagle view. (icons would be great ....)

 - emission REALLY slows it down.



Still to come:
 - menu screen
 - options:
   - difficulty
 - switch left and right through mazes and accept early
 - random orientation
 - larger mazes (efficiency investigation)
 - lose on time out
 - fog effects
 - highlight left and right and up when pressed
 - specific levels (rather than random)
 - specific seed generation
 - sound
 - numbers flashing / changing colour near end
 - instructions / story
 - slide controls
 - ORIENTATION BUG!!!!
 - view heights needs to be percentage-based
 - perhaps have a landscape-friendly layout
 - difficulty should change far clipping plane .... works a treat.
 - slide along walls (instead of getting stuck)
