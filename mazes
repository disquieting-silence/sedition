Ok, so I'm starting to play around with the idea of automatically generating mazes. To do this, I figured I should
probably start to set up a unit testing framework, because of the difficulties in generating paths and such things.
However, when I tried that, I got a junit/textui/ResultPrinter error, because the JUnit shipped with Android was
incompatible with IntelliJ. In order to fix this, I simply used the junit jars in IntelliJ's own directory, and moved
them above the android library in the project dependencies list. That seemed to fix it ... so far.
